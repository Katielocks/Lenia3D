Lenia3D

ðŸš€ Live DemoExplore an interactive 3D Lenia simulation in your browser!

Lenia3D is an exploration of the Lenia continuous cellular automaton in three dimensions. The repository contains the source code for a web application of this:


The web client lives in Javascript/. It uses React for the interface, TensorFlow.js to manage tensors, and custom WebGL shaders for rendering.

Setup

cd Javascript
npm install
npm start

This starts the development server on http://localhost:3000.

To create a production build run:

npm run build

Data

Javascript/src/data/animals3D.js includes a catalog of predefined Lenia creatures encoded in runâ€‘length notation. They can be loaded from the UI.

Attribution & Inspiration

Lenia3D is heavily inspired by Lenia, a system of continuous cellular automata created by Bert Wangâ€‘ChakÂ Chan (@Chakazul). If you are new to Lenia we highly recommend exploring the original project:

Preprint: LeniaÂ â€” Biology of Artificial Life (2019) â€” https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05433

This 3â€‘D extension reâ€‘implements the same kernelâ€‘convolution growth dynamics and continuousâ€‘state philosophy in three spatial dimensions. All credit for the original idea, taxonomy, and many of the kernel and growthâ€‘function parameters goes to Bert Chan.
