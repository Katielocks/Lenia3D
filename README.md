Lenia3D is an exploration of the **Lenia** continuous cellular automaton in three dimensions. The repository contains the source code for a web application:

---



## Javascript Application

The web client uses React for the interface, TensorFlow\.js to manage tensors, and custom WebGL shaders for rendering.

### Setup

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This starts the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

---

## Data

`Javascript/src/data/animals3D.js` includes a catalog of predefined Lenia creatures encoded in runâ€‘length notation. These can be loaded from the UI.

## Attribution & Inspiration

Lenia3D is **heavily inspired by [Lenia](https://github.com/Chakazul/Lenia)**, a system of continuous cellular automata created by **Bert Wangâ€‘ChakÂ Chan** ([@Chakazul](https://github.com/Chakazul)). If you are new to Lenia, we highly recommend exploring the original project:

* **GitHub repository:** [https://github.com/Chakazul/Lenia](https://github.com/Chakazul/Lenia)
* **Interactive web demo:** [https://chakazul.github.io/Lenia/JavaScript/Lenia.html](https://chakazul.github.io/Lenia/JavaScript/Lenia.html)
* **Preprint:** *Lenia â€” Biology of Artificial Life* (2019) â€” [https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05433](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05433)

This 3â€‘D extension reâ€‘implements the same kernelâ€‘convolution growth dynamics and continuousâ€‘state philosophy in three spatial dimensions. All credit for the original idea, taxonomy, and many of the kernel and growthâ€‘function parameters goes to Bert Chan.
